Advent of Code 2024
---

Note, I considered using Swift pretty seriously for 2024. However, I had a hell of a time getting
the latest Swift to even compile on Linux. So, instead I moved to https://github.com/chiroptical/advent_of_code_2024
because `leex` and `yecc` in Erlang are very fun. Erlang also trivially runs on all my hardware. Sorry Swift, maybe
next year.
